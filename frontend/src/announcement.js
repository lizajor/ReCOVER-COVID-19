                       Prof Ajitesh Srivastava is seeking students to fill in multiple student-worker and research assistant positions to assist him in a project on 
                       COIVD-19 scenario projection. The project involves studying the long-term impacts of vaccines, variants, and waning immunity on COVID-19 cases, 
                       deaths, and hospitalizations. This project is a part of the US Scenario Modeling Hub that produces long-term scenario projections and communicates 
                       them to various stakeholders, including the CDC, the White House, and the WHO. Depending on the studentsâ€™ interests and skills, they may work on 
                       the research challenges, implementation, and/or web design for dissemination of results. </p>
                    
                    <p className="article-paragraph"> The project may involve the following skills:
